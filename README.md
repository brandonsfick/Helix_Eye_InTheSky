Machine Learning Enhancements to Home Security Camera System

# Challenge
Many of todayâ€™s home security cameras send users an alert when any movement is detected and recorded. 
Movement can be caused by 
People
Vehicles
Wildlife
Weather (moving tree limbs/leaves, rain, snow, etc.) 
Insects
Blowing trash
Changes in ambient lighting 

Receiving too many false positive alerts can be overwhelming, and can lead users to ignore alerts, or deactivate this important feature altogether.

# Solution
Reduce the number of false positive alerts using a machine learning system to evaluate and identify specific content in a security camera image.

Send alerts only when the presence of a person or unrecognized automobile is captured by the camera.
